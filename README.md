# BTCBIT.net test assignment

A Next.js-based application for currencies wallet inspection. I've written it as a test assignment to BTCBIT.net.
It features a mock-up version of Login & Signup functionality with OTP login, as well as /currencies page where you can observe coins balances, dynamically adjust column amount and remove unnecessary coins.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dac0n/BTCBIT_task

3. Install dependencies:
